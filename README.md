# STL Solids Volume Calculator

CUDA based project to calculate volume of solids given in STL format. The STL format is one of many ways to define solids. It describes 3D figures as combination of many triangles. This program should calculate such solid's volume. 

Application of CUDA solution allows to perform parallel calculations to speed up the performance.
